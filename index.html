            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Jackson, a 15-year-old with a passion for coding, game development, and 3D design. I build games in Python using Pygame to create dynamic gameplay systems and responsive environments. I also work with HTML for web development projects, and I’m currently getting into Unreal Engine to push my game development skills even further.</p>
            <p>In addition to game development, I’m designing programs that utilize OpenAI infrastructure to incorporate AI, enhancing the interactivity of my projects. I’ve worked with Blender for 3D modeling and rendering, applying those skills to design elements in my games. With a GPA of 13.66, I’m always looking for ways to refine my skills and grow as a developer. I’m committed to expanding my knowledge and bringing a high level of technical expertise to each project I work on.</p>
